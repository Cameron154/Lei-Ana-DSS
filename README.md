HPU Software Practicum Project for Blake/Niju/Alex/Cameron/Ron

We are developing software to help advisors visual course management data. With this data, they can better see how certain 
actions will affect students. 

Example 1: A course needs to be cancelled for the semester.
-> The software helps you visualize how many are enrolled in each course this semester to see who is affected.  

Example 2: There is a plan to add an elective for the MSIS program.
-> The software shows everyone enrolled and active in the MSIS program to determine if there are enough students to fill another elective class.

Example 3: There is a need to move a class to a different time.
-> The software can determine, based on all enrolled in the course and their individual course schedules, what times are available/unavailable for the course to be move to in order to accomodate everyone.
